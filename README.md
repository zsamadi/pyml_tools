My developments of machine learning algorithms on python. 
# Contents

[docs](https://github.com/zsamadi/pyml_tools/tree/main/docs)

The materials in docs directory are the refrences I'm using for my developemnets, plus pdf version of the developed jupyter notebooks. 

[sofware](https://github.com/zsamadi/pyml_tools/tree/main/software)

All the code is in the software directory, with a subdirectory for the algorithms. This is a work in progress, future developements of interfaces and utility subdirectories will be placed in this folder.  

[jnotes](https://github.com/zsamadi/pyml_tools/tree/main/jnotes)

Contains jupyter notebook of the example applications of the developed machine learning algorithms. 

[pyapps](https://github.com/zsamadi/pyml_tools/tree/main/pyapps)

Contains functions to apply machine learning algorithms on example input data privided in data folder. 

[data](https://github.com/zsamadi/pyml_tools/tree/main/data)

These are sample training data used to train machine learning algorithms. At the time of this writing they're all from [Andrew NG's machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
